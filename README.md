This is an implementation of inventory management system using python (JSON).
We first inintialize a dictionary with the items in the inventory and then save the content of the dictionary into a json file .
The json fine is retrieved as a dictionary to access the items in the inventory .
We have a while loop that runs until the user makes a wrong choice .
there are 5 choices (i)Browse inventory (ii)Purchase items (iii)Add item in the inventory (iv)Delete an item from the inventory (v)Update inventory Stock .
To browse the inventory we first retrieve the categoriges of the items ,to view the respective items under it .
On purchasing an item the bill is generated,the record.json and sales.json file are updated.
